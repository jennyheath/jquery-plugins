          This arctic sled dog was bred for strength and endurance, and you don't want to get into a wrestling match with an Alaskan Malamute!
          They are incredibly strong, and you will need to commit to obedience training early so that you don't end up struggling to control a full-grown dog.
          They are independent and can be stubborn, so training can be a challenge. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to obey your commands,
          not whether or not they understand. Remember that they were bred to pull, so teaching them to walk on a leash without pulling is a must!
          The Alaskan Malamute has an incredibly high energy level and needs to exercise every day. They are athletic and playful and do best with a fenced-in yard.
          You need to take care that they don't get away, as they have a predator streak, and they have been known to kill livestock and wildlife.
          They can also be the neighborhood cat's worst nightmare. They are usually aggressive with other dogs, especially those of the same sex.
          However, the Malamute loves people. He seems to love everyone equally and is not a "one-man dog" like many other breeds.
          He is ridiculously friendly, and will probably kiss anyone who breaks into your house.

          The Bernese Mountain Dog was bred to be the farmer's companion, and today, a Bernese Mountain Dog will want to be by your side at all times.
          They make a great family dog, and usually single out one person in the household to be their best friend. They are loyal and devoted and will strive to please you.
          They are excellent with kind and gentle children. They are extremely intelligent, and are known for manipulating their humans.
          Because of their intelligence, they need to be mentally stimulated. They are gentle, easygoing, good-natured, affectionate, and docile.
          They are incredibly devoted to their own family, and generally aloof towards strangers. A tendency to be shy runs in the breed, and early socialization is important.
          Most Bernese Mountain Dogs do well with other animals, but some of them do chase smaller animals. They need daily exercise, but not as much as some more energetic breeds.
          They don't enjoy playing fetch and certainly don't make good jogging partners.

          Collies make fantastic family pets because they love to be with people, and love to be part of the family.
          They are great with children and often take a special interest in them.
          The Collie's herding instinct will often cause him to follow his small owners around all day, quietly protecting them.
          Every year Collies receive heroism awards for rescuing children from cars, snakes, and fire.
          Collies are affectionate, intelligent, easygoing, fun-loving, loyal, devoted, and incredibly responsive to their humans.
          Collies seem to have an intuitive awareness of a family's routines and activities and are sometimes accused of "reading their owner's mind."
          They are known to recognize approaching footsteps and vehicles, and are often found waiting by the door when it is the regular
          time for someone to get home from work or school.
